# Home Assistant Configuration

This repository contains my Home Assistant setup for automating a smart home. It covers features such as lighting automation, climate control, plant care and notifications.

## Highlights
- **Lighting automation** manages lights in multiple rooms using scenarios for comfort and energy savings.
- **Climate control** integrates heaters, air conditioners and humidifiers to maintain ideal conditions.
- **Plant monitoring** tracks moisture and other parameters for several plants and sends reminders for watering or fertilizing.
- **Notifications** via Telegram and Yandex keep you informed about important events.

## Configuration Files
- `configuration.yaml` ties everything together.
- Helper files like `helper.yaml` and `variables.yaml` store helper functions and entities.
- Notification files configure Telegram and Yandex alerts.
- Plant configuration files track the health of various plants.
- Room automation files manage lighting and other devices in each room.
- Telegram bot configuration (`telegram_bot.yaml`) enables interactive control of the home.

The Telegram bot provides an interactive menu to control rooms and systems, monitor sensor data and manage devices directly from chat.
